# Enhanced Cardiac Diagnosis via Hierarchical Deep Learning with Generative Adversarial Network for ECG Signal Analysis 

The recent medical reports highlight the increase in the rise in cardiac complications post- 
COVID-19 infection. This results in an increase in the death ratio which could be reduced to a 
certain level if the cardiac arrest has been predicted well in advance. The fatality rate can greatly 
reduce if the symptoms are diagnosed early and proper precautions are taken. In this direction, 
researchers have been focusing to integrate of technology in the traditional ECG analysis. In 
this regard, we propose a framework “ECG analysis using GAN and Encoder-Decoder” that 
can accommodate state of art deep learning approaches for early detection of abnormalities in 
the Electrocardiogram (ECG). Further, users can upload their image form of ECG through our 
web portal, in spite of being at remote places. The portal analysis the ECG image with well- 
trained model and respond the status through the cloud. In the experimentation, we have used 
hybrid dataset for the model development and deployment. For enhancing the reliability and 
accuracy we have used both GAN and auto encoder. The results are encouraging with an 
accuracy of 96%(GAN). In conclusion, this offers significant implications for advancing 
cardiac healthcare, offering clinicians and researchers a more accurate and reliable diagnostic 
tool for identifying cardiac abnormalities.
